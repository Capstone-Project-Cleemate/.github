# Cleemate: Smart Health Recommendations
(https://github.com/Capstone-Project-Cleemate/.github/blob/main/Cleemate.png)
## About the Project
Our project, Cleemate, addresses the rising health risks caused by drastic climate changes, including extreme weather and pollution. According to the WHO, climate-related health impacts could lead to over 250,000 deaths annually by 2050. Despite this, many people, especially in developing countries like Indonesia, lack access to personalized health guidance during extreme weather events. This app uses artificial intelligence (AI) to provide tailored recommendations for health maintenance and recovery, helping users make better decisions in adverse climate conditions.
The app collects real-time environmental data, such as weather and temperature, and analyzes it with AI to generate personalized health recommendations. Features include daily health and hydration tracking, notifications for severe weather, and an easy-to-use dashboard. This system aims to empower individuals to proactively manage their health by bridging the gap between climate data and actionable advice. It is specifically designed to be accessible and adaptive, addressing the diverse needs of the Indonesian population.
To achieve this, we leverage advanced tools like TensorFlow for machine learning, Android Studio for app development, and Google Cloud Platform for backend infrastructure. Our team also emphasizes data privacy and inclusion, ensuring the app meets ethical standards while serving diverse communities. This innovative solution aspires to minimize health disparities by promoting resilience against climate-related challenges.
